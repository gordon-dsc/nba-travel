# NBA Travel, Rest, and Performance Data 

## Project Overview

This project looks at how travel and rest may relate to NBA player performance during the
2024–2025 NBA season. Using a reproducible data pipeline, this project makes clean,
analysis ready tables that have player game logs, geographic information, and city rankings.

The units of analysis for the main dataset is one row per player per game. Player performance is
looked at using points per minute played and schedule related factors, like days of rest
and back-to-backs. Geographic info is added using city location data and latitude/longitude coordinates.

The workflow of the project focuses on three NBA players of different calibers:
- Jayson Tatum
- Dejounte Murray
- Quentin Grimes

The pipeline is designed to be applied to league analysis with additional player
game logs.
