## Purpose

This script collects raw NBA data needed to study how travel and rest impact player performance
during the 2024–2025 season. All data imported here is saved to `data/imported_data/` as uncleaned
files and will be processed later in `cleaning.qmd`.


## Import example player game log

Below is a raw game log table scraped from Basketball Reference.
```{r}
library(rvest)

url <- "https://www.basketball-reference.com/players/t/tatumja01/gamelog/2025"

player_page <- read_html(url)

tables <- html_elements(player_page, "table")

game_log <- html_table(tables[[8]])

game_log
dir.create("data/imported_data", recursive = TRUE, showWarnings = FALSE)
saveRDS(game_log, "data/imported_data/tatum_game_log_raw.rds")
```
